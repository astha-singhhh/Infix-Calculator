Infix Calculator Project

Synopsis: 

This project consists of source code files and their class files: DoubleNode.java, DoublyLinkedList.java, InfixCalculator.java, MyDoublyLinkedList.java, MyQueue.java, MyStack.java, Node.java, Queue.java, SimpleLinkedList.java, Stack.java. The purpose of this project is to implement java methods to create an infix calculator that takes in an input file containing infix expression, then translates the infix expressions to postfix expressions, then evaluates the results and writes the calculations to an output file.

InfixCalculator has a main method for running the program and all the various methods that make up an infix calculator. The files DoubleNode, MyDoublyLinkedList, MyQueue, DoublyLinkedList, and Queue are classes and interfaces that create a doubly linked list queue implementation. The files MyStack, Node, SimpleLinkedList, SingleLinkedList, and Stack are the classes for a singly linked list stack implementation.

My program supports modulo (%) and exponentiation (^) operators. 
It does not require blanks spaces (i.e. allow users to input "5+7*2" as well as "5 + 7 * 2" ). 
It also supports negative and positve numbers (i.e.allow users to input " -5 + -7 * +2").
